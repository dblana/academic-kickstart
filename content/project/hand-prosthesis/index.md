Even though prosthetic hands have the potential for complex movements, it is difficult to interpret the user's desired action. Here we used a computer model of the hand to translate muscle activity from the residual limb into prosthetic hand movement. I described this work in a [series of blog posts](https://medium.com/the-quest-for-a-life-like-prosthetic-hand/tagged/science).

In 2018, I led the development of an exhibit about prosthetic hands at the <a href="">[Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition](https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2018/summer-science-exhibition/exhibits/progressive-prosthetics/). It was a unique experience, that involved designing hands-on activities for people of all ages, and managing a large group of volunteers. The exhibition had more than 11000 visitors! I documented the preparation for the exhibit on a blog: [The quest for a life-like prosthetic hand](https://medium.com/the-quest-for-a-life-like-prosthetic-hand).
