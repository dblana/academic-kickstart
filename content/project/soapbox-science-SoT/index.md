[Soapbox Science](https://soapboxscience.org/) involves female scientists standing on soapboxes in busy city streets, talking with passers-by about their research.

I think it is a brilliant outreach platform, for two reasons. First, instead of inviting people to a dedicated science event, it takes science to the streets, so it reaches people who might not consider attending a science event. And second, by focusing on female scientists, is raises the visibility of women in STEM, and hopefully encourages more girls to study science and engineering.

I set up the Stoke-on-Trent branch of Soapbox Science, and on Saturday July 6th 2019, we hosted our first ever Soapbox Science event in the centre of Stoke-on-Trent. It was a great opportunity to learn about scientific research done locally, straight from the scientists themselves.
