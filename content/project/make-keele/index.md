While I was working at Keele University, I set up a makerspace for the local community called [Make Keele](https://www.keele.ac.uk/make/). Its aim was to get people of all ages and backgrounds tinkering with technology, and give them the opportunity to meet, learn from each other and get creative. Through this project I met the team behind [Wavemaker](https://www.wavemaker.org.uk/), digital engagement specialists, who became good friends and collaborators.

As part of Make Keele, I started a local branch of [Code Up](https://codeup.org.uk/), an organisation based in Manchester, which aims to provide free coding tuition to adults. While children learn coding at school, I wanted to give adults the same opportunity: to learn coding at no cost, in a friendly environment.
